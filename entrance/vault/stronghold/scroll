There is a fine golden goblet on a nearby table.

You move toward it to take it, but your hand passes through
it as if it were illusory, but you know this cannot be.

You remember a spell your magick teacher, Caitlin the Green,
taught you long ago: a spell to copy an object.

Use that spell now, and then run the goblet script.

Hint:
* Copy the goblet-light object to goblet-dark
* There are several commands you can use.
* If you get stuck, run the goblet script.
