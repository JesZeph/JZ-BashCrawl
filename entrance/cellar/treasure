You have found an emerald **amulet**!"

To collect treasure, you must have a variable to hold your inventory.

Create a variable and add your treasure to it like this:

export I=amulet,\$I

You can always check your wealth with this command:

echo \$I

EOF
    mv ../.chapel ../chapel 2>/dev/null
    mv ../.vault ../vault 2>/dev/null
    mv ../.scrap ../scrap 2>/dev/null
else
    echo "This treasure has already been taken."

# Hmm, that didn't work.
# Try moving into the armoury, maybe you
# can come back to this treasure later!
